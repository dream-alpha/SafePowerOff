		<h1>SafePowerOff Installation</h1>
                To install SafePowerOff execute the following command in a telnet console on your dreambox:
		<p>		
		wget --no-check-certificate https://dream-alpha.github.io/SafePowerOff/safepoweroff.sh -O - | /bin/sh
		<p>
		Due to problems with busybox wget it is recommended to install a standalone wget package ("apt-get install wget").
